# Important Info

We recommend that you have the reservation information available to present at the rental car counter to simplify the pick-up process.
Payment for this reservation is due when the car is returned and will be charged by Budget Rent a Car.
Additional charges may apply at the counter if you pick up or drop off the car at a different date, time, or location than stated on your reservation.
Only the driver will be able to pick up this rental car at the counter. An additional driver may be added at the counter for a fee payable directly to the rental car company.
Additional charges may apply for drivers under the age of 25.
Budget Rent a Car will charge the driver at the rental counter for optional items added to the reservation, including any child seats or special requests.
The driver will be required to present a valid driver's license and a valid credit card in his/her name at the counter for the refundable security deposit. Rental car companies may have different requirements for customers who will only have a debit card at the time of pick-up, such as multiple forms of identification, age restrictions, or proof of round-trip airline travel. For more specific information or to determine whether a debit card deposit is allowed, please review acceptable payment options in the partner's policy information. Pre-paid cards or cash will not be accepted for the security deposit.
If you are renting locally, please review the location specific rental policy for potential additional restrictions. Qualifying a local renter varies by rental company, but they will typically use the address on your license, or the issuing state of your license, to determine locality.
Your car will be reserved for unlimited mileage, but some car companies have additional restrictions regarding mileage such as boundary and local renter restrictions.
Some locations collect fees, or tolls, for access to certain roadways. Some tolls may be cashless and fees are paid via an electronic toll collection program. Budget Rent a Car may have a specific policy regarding cashless tolls, or offer the option to participate in their electronic toll collection program. We recommend you speak to the counter agent upon arrival about whether this may affect you.
Please see location specific rental policy and rules information.
