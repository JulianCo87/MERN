# Credit Card Policies
Budget accepts most major credit cards as credit identification at the time of rental. The renter's name must be on the credit card.
Specialty or Signature Series Vehicles: 2 CREDIT CARDS in the renter's name are required to rent ALL Specialty or Signature Series vehicles.
Accepted credit card list: Budget Charge Card, Budget International, American Express, Diner's Club, Diner's Club International, Discover, China UnionPay, JCB, MasterCard, Optima, and Visa. Some locations may not accept each of the referenced cards.
You may be subject to a credit check or present additional identification. Acceptable forms of additional identification are: Valid passport or travel visa, military identification, birth certificate, marriage license, ATM card with customer name printed on face of card, health care identification card with customer?s name printed on face of card or company/college/university identification with a photograph. In some cases, you may be required to present an alternate credit card.
Budget may request an authorization hold against your account for the estimated rental charges of the rental, but reserves the right in its sole discretion to request an extra value to be based on certain factors as we deem appropriate:
Most rentals may require an authorization hold of the estimated rental charges plus $200.00 USD.
If you have prepaid the rental, the hold amount will be $250.00 USD.
While this hold is in place, the funds will not be available for your use. When the rental is over, we will process the reversal, but the bank may take time to post it back to the account.
Note: Prepaid credit cards are not acceptable methods of credit identification to pick up a car at any location. One of the above mentioned cards must be presented. Prepaid credit cards are accepted at time of return only, if we can obtain full authorization from the card bank for the total charges due.
Please Note: The renter may be subject to a credit check or present additional identification. Acceptable forms of additional identification are: Valid passport or travel visa, military identification, birth certificate, marriage license, ATM card with customer name printed on face of card, health care identification card with customer?s name printed on face of card or company/college/university identification with a photograph.

Debit Card Policies
This location does accept bank debit cards with the MasterCard or Visa logo at the time of rental for specific car groups with the following requirements:
Renter must be at least 25 years of age.
The name of the renter must be on the debit card.
A debit card is accepted as credit identification for all car groups except for makes and models identified as specialty vehicles (car group X vehicles) and certain other premium vehicles like convertibles.
At airport locations, you will be required to show proof of a return airline flight that corresponds with your rental.
You will be subject to a credit check to determine and ensure credit worthiness before releasing the car to you. If your credit file is frozen with Equifax, you will be required to lift the restriction prior to your rental. Lifting the restriction does not guarantee that you will be able to rent a vehicle as you will still be subject to a credit check.
Budget will generally request an authorization hold against your account for the estimated rental charges of the rental, but reserves the right in its sole discretion to request an extra value to be based on certain factors as we deem appropriate:
Most rentals may require an authorization hold of the estimated rental charges plus $200 USD.
Rentals of 4 days or more may require an authorization hold of the estimated rental charges plus $300 USD.
If you have prepaid the rental with a debit card, the hold is $250.00 USD.
THESE FUNDS WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR YOUR USE. When the rental is over, we will process the reversal, but the bank may take time to post it back to the account. If you fail to return the vehicle as agreed, Budget will obtain additional authorizations from your account to cover the rental charges. Budget is not responsible for any returned checks or overdraft fees based on this policy.
Positive identification in addition to your driver's license may be required.
Note: Prepaid Debit/Gift cards are not acceptable methods of credit identification to pick up a car at any location. Prepaid Debit/Gift cards are accepted at time of return only, if we can obtain full authorization from the card bank for the total charges due.
Optional Coverages
Acceptance of Loss Damage Waiver relieves the renter and authorized additional drivers of financial responsibility if the Budget car is damaged or stolen while under rental contract. Using the vehicle in violation of any of the use restrictions listed on the rental agreement could void LDW and leave the renter fully responsible for any damage to the vehicle.
LDW is not available in all states and certain restrictions may apply in some states. At the time of rental, the customer must initial whether he/she accepts or declines the LDW and/or other optional services. LDW and other optional services must be signed for at the rental counter.
If LDW is not accepted, the customer may be responsible for up to the full fair market value of the car if it is damaged, vandalized or stolen during the rental. The customer may also be responsible for reimbursing Budget for the revenue lost by not being able to use the car while it is being repaired or not recovered due to theft (referred to as Loss Of Use).
Towing
Towing is not permitted. Vehicles cannot be used to tow or push anything. A trailer hitch cannot be installed on the vehicles.

The following are exempt from the fee but must meet all other driver requirements: the renter's employer or fellow employee when on company business and renting under a corporate account; the renter's spouse or domestic partner; the companion driver of a renter with a disability who has completed the non-licensed renter form; for insurance replacement rentals, company employees or family members who are designated on the insurance policy. . All other additional drivers must complete and sign an additional driver form and present valid credit identification. A maximum of two additional drivers may complete a form.
Fuel Policy
Fuel Service Charge. Most rentals come with a full tank of fuel, but that is not always the case.
Where available, if permitted by law, if you drive less than 75 miles, you acknowledge that we will add a flat fee to the rental, the amount of which will be disclosed on the Rental Contract and at the counter prior to rental. You may avoid this charge at time of return by providing a receipt for fuel purchased at which time the flat fee will be reversed from your total rental charges. If this subparagraph (a) does not apply, there are three refueling options:
1) If you do not accept the fuel service option, where available, at the beginning of your rental, and you return the car with less fuel than was in it when you received it, as we determine in our sole discretion, we will charge you a fuel service charge at the applicable rate per-mile or rate per-gallon specified on the Rental Contract or disclosed at the location. The per-mile rate is used if you do not buy fuel during the rental. To calculate this amount, we multiply the number of miles driven, as shown on the car?s odometer (or provided by the vehicle's telematics device), times the per-mile rate shown on the Rental Contract. The per gallon rate is used if you buy fuel during the rental and provide us with a receipt on our request, but the tank is not as full when you return the car as when you received the car (by using the factory installed gauge, rounded down to the nearest 1/8 tank), times the per-gallon rate shown on the Rental Contract.
Although two methods are used for ease of calculation, the per mile and per-gallon rates produce approximately the same result. Some of our cars are equipped with onboard telematics which record the actual amounts of fuel in the gas tank. In the event your car has such a device, you will be charged for the actual amount of gasoline needed to fill the tank based on the reading of this device.
2) If you accept the fuel service option at the beginning of your rental, you will be charged as shown on the Rental Contract for that purchase and you will not pay us a fuel service charge. If you choose this option, you will not incur an additional fuel service charge, but you will not receive any credit for fuel left in the tank at the time of return. If you accept the partial fuel service option at the beginning of your rental, you will be charged as shown on the Rental Contract for that purchase and you will pay a fuel service charge for any fuel not covered by the partial fuel service option. The per-gallon cost of the fuel service option will always be lower than the fuel service charge. The cost of refueling the car yourself at a local service station may be lower than the fuel service charge or the fuel service option. You acknowledge that the fuel service charge is not a retail sale of fuel.
3) You may avoid a fuel service charge if you return the car with the fuel tank as full as when you received it and, if requested by us, present a receipt for your fuel purchase. If you put fuel into the car, you must use the correct fuel (having the grade of gasoline stated on the car fuel information decal, or on-road diesel). Do not use ethanol fuel even if the car states that it is a flex-fuel vehicle.
Additional Fees and Credit Holds
Additional Fees
Except for a surcharge for renters under 25 years of age at some locations, your total rental rate is calculated based on the information provided at time of reservation. The rate is based on the exact parameters (location, dates, etc.) of your particular rental, so changing any of your confirmed reservation parameters could result in different rates, taxes and fees.
Quoted taxes and fees are subject to change which will affect your final total due at rental return.
Vehicles are rented on a daily (24-hour) basis with a 29-minute grace period for returns. After 30 minutes late, a 3/4-day late charge + $.01 + taxes apply. After 90 minutes late, full-day late charges + taxes apply.
If you reserve any type of vehicle that requires a credit card hold and you no longer require the rental, you must cancel the reservation before the scheduled pick-up time or you will be charged a $75.00 fee ($50.00 for a budget.com paid rental).
The U.S. Government imposes a $5.00 per day Admin Rate Supplement (GARS) for U.S. Government rentals.
If you selected an Optional Product (coverages, GPS, child safety seat, Roadside SafetyNet, XM Radio, etc.) with your rental:
Prohibited use of your rental vehicle will void the Roadside SafetyNet Option.
The Fuel Service Option price is not included in your reservation total. The prevailing market rate for fuel plus associated tax and fees will be charged when you return your car.
You are responsible for replacement costs if the Optional Product or its components are lost, stolen or damaged. Products are charged on a daily (24-hour) basis. There is no grace period for returns of Optional Products, so full-day late charges will apply.
If you used a coupon for your reservation:
Most savings are reflected in your quoted rate. If your rental meets all coupon terms, any additional rate adjustment will be made when you pick up your car.
For an upgrade, your reserved car will be upgraded at time of rental subject to car availability. This upgrade may not be used in conjunction with any other coupon, promotion or deal.
The value of your coupon has been deducted from the base rate (time and mileage) charges and is reflected in the approximate total. Paper coupons, however, may not be applied online and should be presented at the counter. Please refer to all coupons for the full terms. Restrictions may apply.
Once you have picked up the car, if you wish to extend the rental return date past your originally scheduled time, you must call 800-824-6287. A service fee of $10.00 will apply and your original per-day rental rate may change. If you don't call to extend your rental within 7 hours of your originally scheduled return time, a late fee will apply.
A Frequent Traveler Program Surcharge or Excise Tax of up to $1.50 per day may be applied and will be assessedin connection with miles, points or credits earned pursuant to this reservation.
